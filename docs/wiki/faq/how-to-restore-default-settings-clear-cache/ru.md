In order to do a reset you need to:

 * Click in the upper left corner to bring up the menu, or swipe it from the left to the right
 * Long click on the desire Profile name 
 * Confirm your action " OK"

*After confirmation, the program will restart and will reset all settings to default.*

**Bookmarks, tags, and reading progress you have added are not deleted on reset.**
