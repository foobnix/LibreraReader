    <p>Provides stream classes for the
      <a href="https://github.com/google/snappy">Snappy</a>
      algorithm.</p>

    <p>The raw Snappy format which only contains the compressed data
      is supported by the <code>SnappyCompressor*putStream</code>
      classes while the so called "framing format" is implemented
      by <code>FramedSnappyCompressor*putStream</code>.  Note there
      have been different versions of the framing format specification,
      the implementation in Commons Compress is based on the
      specification "Last revised: 2013-10-25".</p>

    <p>Only the "framing format" can be auto-detected this means you
      have to speficy the format explicitly if you want to read a
      "raw" Snappy stream
      via <code>CompressorStreamFactory</code>.</p>
