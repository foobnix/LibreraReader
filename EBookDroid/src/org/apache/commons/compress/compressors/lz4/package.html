    <p>Provides stream classes for the
      <a href="http://lz4.github.io/lz4/">LZ4</a>
      algorithm.</p>

    <p>The block LZ4 format which only contains the compressed data is
      supported by the <code>BlockLZ4Compressor*putStream</code>
      classes while the frame format is implemented
      by <code>FramedLZ4Compressor*putStream</code>.  The
      implementation in Commons Compress is based on the
      specifications "Last revised: 2015-03-26" for the block format
      and version "1.5.1 (31/03/2015)" for the frame format.</p>

    <p>Only the frame format can be auto-detected this means you have
      to speficy the format explicitly if you want to read a block LZ4
      stream via <code>CompressorStreamFactory</code>.</p>
